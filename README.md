# HTML Structure Project

This project is the first step in building a webpage from a Figma design. The goal here is **to write the HTML structure only** — no CSS or JavaScript. We focus on clean, semantic, and accessible HTML that will be the base for future styling.

---

## 🎯 Goal

* Recreate the layout of the Figma design using **semantic HTML5 tags** (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`, etc.).
* Do not include any CSS or inline styles.
* The structure should reflect the design hierarchy only.

## 🛠️ Resources
